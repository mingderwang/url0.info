Mark what?
--------

**Markdown** is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

This **HTML5** web application allows you to create texts using Markdown syntax and see the instant preview on the right panel.

You can use your own CSS file if you like. Just drag it from your desktop to the *"Drop your CSS file(s) here."* mark. **Don't worry, your css file will not be uploaded.**

###Why, who?

I, [Jr. Hames][6], love Markdown and it's simplicity, but I can't find an editor that's just good and simple as such. That's why I create this web app. Actually, I liked it so much, that I wrote this entire text right here, after finishing the code.

I hope you like it. Please, feel free to contact me if you have any questions/suggestions or found a issue.

###We use:

- **[Showdown][2]**, a Javascript port of Markdown.
- **[FileSaver.js][3]**, implements the `W3C saveAs()` FileSaver interface in browsers that do not natively support it.
- **[BlobBuilder.js][4]**, implements the `W3C BlobBuilder` interface in browsers that do not natively support it.
- A modified version of **[Markdown.css][5]**, a better default styling for your Markdown files. You can download our custom version [here][7].
