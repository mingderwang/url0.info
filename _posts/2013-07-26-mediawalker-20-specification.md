## Overview

This document provides the specification of the API which can be used for developing devices, applications or services to interact with any social media service running on top of a MediaWalker engine 2.0 or above. The core are implemented as a set of RESTful API which you can be access anywhere from Internet via the http protocol, which can be called by almost any computer language, such as Jacascript, Java, php, C#, Ruby, Python, and so on.


### What is MediaWalker?

MediaWalker is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) for a peer-to-peer social media network. Not only provide a flexible and high-availability cloud service for media sharing, it also provides a non-blocking peer-to-peer message communication for operators to implement their business logic and connecting all the workflows together. Meanwhile, the respective API will be available for developers to implement applications or services on desktops, websites, mobile devices, or event sensors or any IoT, such as printers or any Arduino devices.

For implementing most of the social media service features, MediaWalker 2.0 includes some must-have modules to provide the basic functions, such as user account management with web identity federation, media (file) storage, meta data searching, and sharing, notification and messaging queuing, and so on. Beside the built-in modules, MediaWalker engine also provides some interfaces to communicate with existing Internet blobstore services, such as Amazon S3, SNS, SQS, etc. For more details about available modules in 2.0 will be listed in the specification section.
